# Mini-Haskell-to-do-list
A fully functional Haskell CLI To-Do List app with task creation, viewing, updating, filtering, and deletion. Tasks are stored in JSON for persistence. Features modular code, input validation, and date handling. Ideal for learning Haskell. Future plans include a web UI with Scotty, HTML, and CSS.
